      "The decision of the European Parliament and the Council to provide macro-financial assistance to the Republic of North Macedonia demonstrates the unwavering commitment of the European Union to the Western Balkans. The COVID-19 pandemic and energy crisis have had a significant impact on North Macedonia's economy, exacerbating its financing gap, deteriorating external position, and growing fiscal needs. The government has shown a strong commitment to implementing reforms, including the judiciary, good governance, and the rule of law, and the IMF has approved a precautionary and liquidity line of up to EUR 530,000,000. Given its candidacy for EU membership and the accessions negotiations that have begun, North Macedonia is eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. The EU's decision to provide untied and undesignated balance-of-payment support to North Macedonia should help address the country's immediate external financing needs and underpin its implementation of a policy program containing strong adjustment and structural reform measures designed to improve its balance-of-payments position in the short term. This decision underscores the EU's commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Western Balkans, strengthening its neighborhood policies and supporting reforms that promote democracy, prosperity, and security. Overall, the decision of the European Union to provide macro-financial assistance to the Republic of North Macedonia demonstrates the EU's commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Western Balkans. The assistance, which complements resources made available by the IMF and the World Bank, should help address the country's immediate external financing needs and support its implementation of a policy program containing strong adjustment and structural reform measures. The assistance should also support the Union's external policy towards North Macedonia and the country's commitment to shared values such as democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. The Commission should monitor North Macedonia's fulfilment of preconditions and objectives and ensure the protection of the Union's financial interests.

The assistance will be managed by the Commission, which will regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of developments relating to that assistance and provide them with the relevant documents.
